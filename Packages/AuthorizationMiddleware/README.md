# AuthorizationMiddleware

## Overview

This package provides a helper for basic authorization for an API client generated with the [open-api generator](https://github.com/apple/swift-openapi-generator). 

## Usage

The authorization middleware can be used in the initializer of the API Client like:

```swift
import AuthorizationMiddleware
import OpenAPIRuntime
import OpenAPIURLSession

public class APIClient {
	
	/// Autogenerated api client with OpenAPI-generator
	private var client: Client
	
	/// Create an API Client
	/// - Parameter serverUrl: the url for the service
	/// - Parameter username: basic authentication user name
	/// - Parameter password: basic authentication password
	required public init(serverUrl: Foundation.URL, username: String?, password: String?) {
		
		if let username, let password {
			let authenticationMiddleWare = AuthorizationMiddleware(
				username: username,
				password: password
			)
			self.client = Client(
				serverURL: serverUrl,
				transport: URLSessionTransport(),
				middlewares: [authenticationMiddleWare]
			)
		} else {
			self.client = Client(
				serverURL: serverUrl,
				transport: URLSessionTransport()
			)
		}
	}
}
```

## Contribution process

The development team works on the repository in a private fork (for reasons of compliance with existing processes) and shares its work as often as possible.

If you plan to make non-trivial changes, we recommend to open an issue beforehand where we can discuss your planned changes. This increases the chance that we might be able to use your contribution (or it avoids doing work if there are reasons why we wouldn't be able to use it).

Note that all commits should be signed using a [gpg key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/adding-a-gpg-key-to-your-github-account).
